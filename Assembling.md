**NOTE: Currently pins may feel very loose, this is by design to allow for room for glue or epoxy (recommended) to set.  Normally press fit is good enough for testined, but for actual use make sure to secure the pins properly.**

**NOTE: D2HW shuttle is not compatible with Hall Effects, and D2HW back plate will affect cooling.**

## Assembling Shuttle and Backplates

In order to get proper matching set you should:
- insert pins in your best backplate (straightest)
- press bushings in the shuttle and ensure a smooth mating between the parts.
- if everything feels smooth, pop the bushings out and glue them in place using either superglue or epoxy, other wise see [Tips and Tricks](#tips-and-tricks)
- be sure to test that the mating still feels smooth after the glue sets.
- You can now use the shuttle as a "master blank" for glueing the pins into all your backplates.


## Tips and Tricks

### Heat Treating

If you printed the shuttle and backplate and things are just not smooth or you have slight binding, you can Heat Treat it and here is how.
- Fully assemble the shuttle and backplate with Bushing, Pins, Screws and Magnets
- Set your heat bed to 100-110Â°C
- Once at temperature, mate both parts fully, and set them on the bed with the backplate (tool side) down
- After 20+ minutes pick them up and slide them 3-4 times, then fully mate them once again
- Set down on the backplate (tool side) someplace cool (Desk) and let them cool without touching them for 5+ hours
- Try and slide them again and you should feel an improvement, you can try this multiple times if you are still not satisfied

Big thank you to `unguided-wanderer` on Discord for this technique.


## Preload

To set your preload you want to back the FSCS screws till they are just touching the magnest on the shuttle.  You can use a piece of paper per side to make sure they both have the same pressure.  This should remove all the wiggle when it's fully seated.  **NOTE** Every backplate needs to be adjusted.
