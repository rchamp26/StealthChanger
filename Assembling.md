# Assembling

In order to get proper matching set you should:
- insert pins in your best backplate (straightest)
- press bushings in the shuttle and ensure a smooth mating between the parts.
- if everything feels smooth, pop the bushings out and glue them in place using either superglue or epoxy.
- be sure to test that the mating still feels smooth after the glue sets.
- You can now use the shuttle as a "master blank" for glueing the pins into all your backplates.
