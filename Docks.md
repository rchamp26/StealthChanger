Currently all docks used with [Viesturz's Tapchanger](https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger) are compatible.  In the future we might develop our own.

**NOTE: the DB dock in the Tapchanger repo uses custom Cowl that is not compatible or supported by Stealthchanger.  We recommend to always use the original cowls for all tools.  If you mods use that dock please see the [usermod](https://github.com/Hellsparks/StealthChanger/blob/main/UserMods/OstroMa/DB_Cowl_v8_with_TapChanger_Dock_Hooks.stl) for a merged version with proper original bolt locations.**
