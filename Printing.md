## Parts

**NOTE: the DB dock in the Tapchanger repo uses custom Cowl that is not compatible or supported by Stealthchanger.  We recommend to always use the original cowls for all tools.  If you must use that dock please see the [Usermods](https://github.com/Hellsparks/StealthChanger/blob/main/UserMods/OstroMa/DB_Cowl_v8_with_TapChanger_Dock_Hooks.stl) for a merged version with proper original bolt locations.**


Coming Soon


## Settings

All print settings are the same as [Voron Standards](https://docs.vorondesign.com/sourcing.html#print-settings) or better.


## Orientation

Print orientation is flat on the parts back with supports enabled currently, we are working on models with integrated supports.
