## Parts

**NOTE: If you plan on using the Tapchanger Dragonburner dock you must use the [custom cowl by OstroMa](https://github.com/DraftShift/StealthChanger/blob/main/UserMods/OstroMa/DB_Cowl_v8_with_TapChanger_Dock_Hooks.stl). We always recommend to use the original cowls when possible and the [Modular Dock](https://github.com/DraftShift/ModularDock) does not require any special Cowl, print the original from the Dragonburner repo.**


Coming Soon


## Settings

All print settings are the same as [Voron Standards](https://docs.vorondesign.com/sourcing.html#print-settings) or better.


## Orientation

Print orientation is flat on the parts back with supports enabled currently, we are working on models with integrated supports.

## Tips and Tricks

### Heat Treating

If you print the shuttle and backplate and things are just not smooth or you have slight binding, you can Heat Treat it and here is how.
- Full assemble the shuttle and backplate with Bushing, Pins, Screws and Magnets
- Set your heatbed to 100-110Â°C
- Once at temperature set mate both parts fully, and set them on the bed with the backplate (tool side) down
- After 20+ minutes pick them up and slide them 3-4 times, then fully reseat them
- Let them cool without touching them for 5+ hours
- Try them again and you shoudl see an improvement if it's still not 100% feel free to repeat the Heat Treatment

Big thank you to `unguided-wanderer` on Discord for this technique.
