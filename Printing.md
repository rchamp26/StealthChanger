## Parts

**NOTE: If you plan on using the Tapchanger Dragonburner dock you must use the [custom cowl by OstroMa](https://github.com/DraftShift/StealthChanger/blob/main/UserMods/OstroMa/DB_Cowl_v8_with_TapChanger_Dock_Hooks.stl). We always recommend to use the original cowls when possible and the [Modular Dock](https://github.com/DraftShift/ModularDock) does not require any special Cowl, print the original from the Dragonburner repo.**


Coming Soon


## Settings

All print settings are the same as [Voron Standards](https://docs.vorondesign.com/sourcing.html#print-settings) or better.


## Orientation

Print orientation is flat on the parts back with supports enabled currently, we are working on models with integrated supports.
