1. After printing the parts make sure that the hex holes look to be hexes.  If they are misshapen chances are you need to reprint as you will have alignment issues.  It doesn't take much to be out by a lot.  Try printing at a slower speed if you have issues.

2. Dragon Burners require 60mm per tool
Stealth Burners require 80mm per tool
The gantry required about 20mm per side to be able to pass the tools.  To know how many tools you can fit it's simple math, measure that top bar -40mm to gantry and then divide the remainder by the size of your toolhead.
